Hello, all. I'm Kendall (they/them), @candlebrew

I'm a programmer, student, and writer with many varied interests. I've been "programming" since 2010 by using ChoiceScript and utilizing it to create procedural generators in order to aid my writing by being able to generate random NPCs and names in alien languages. I moved on to RenPy and Python in January 2016, as well as learning HTML, Javascript, and CSS along the way, then transferred my skills from ChoiceScript to Python for more procedural generation, before now where I am currently focusing on Discord bot development and Postgres supplementing my studies.

Outside of programming, I like tabletop RPGs and would like to one day own my own game publishing company (both video games & tabletop). I am writing my own RPG system which I hope to publish 2023. I also like video games, reading, music composition (I play Kalimba & Lyre), and language learning. I am currently studying Japanese (I am JLPT N5), Spanish, and Hebrew.

In the meantime, I'm attending UCO for Psychology and will be attending Texas State for my master's in Counseling. I want to one day work with clients with disabilities such as Autism and ADHD and develop software and apps to help people with disabilities, as well as tools to assist psychologists in diagnosing their clients.
